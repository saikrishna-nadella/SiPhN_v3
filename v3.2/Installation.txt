   b. run following commands one after the other
      pip install numpy
      pip install matplotlib
      pip install pyqt5
      pip install pandas
      pip install pytz
      pip install XlsxWriter
   c. You are done! go to Step 8

7. With PC offline >>>
   a. Go to a differnt PC which has internet connection. Open web browser and visit https://pypi.org
   b. on the Home page, in Search bar, search for following items and download the .whl files SUITABLE for your platform (x86/x64). For reference, the filenames that need to be selected for Windows 10 64 bit PC with python3.8 is given below.
       	numpy          	--> numpy-1.18.1-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
		pyparsing	--> pyparsing-2.4.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl
		certifi		--> certifi-2020.11.8-py2.py3-none-any.whl
		six		--> six-1.14.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
		dateutil	--> python_dateutil-2.8.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        	setuptools	--> setuptools-41.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
		cycler		--> cycler-0.10.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
		kiwisolver	--> kiwisolver-1.1.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
		Pillow		--> Pillow-8.0.1-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

	matplotlib     	--> matplotlib-3.1.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
      		pyqt5-sip	--> PyQt5_sip-12.7.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
      	pyqt5	    	--> PyQt5-5.14.2-5.14.2-cp35.cp36.cp37.cp38-none-win_amd64.whl
	pandas		--> pandas-1.1.2-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
	pytz		--> pytz-2020.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
	XlsxWriter	--> XlsxWriter-1.3.7-py2.py3-none-any.whl
	
  c. after downloading all the wheel files for above modules, keep all of them in C:\Users\<userName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts folder.
  d. Open commandPrompt in that folder and install above .whl files one by one, in the same order as mentioned above, by running 
	pip install <name of .whl file>
  e. You are done! go to Step 8

8. Extract the received SiPhNv3.2-03102022.zip to required location and enter to that extracted folder
